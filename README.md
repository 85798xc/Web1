Marshaling and un-marshaling
Description
Create Java application which transforms Java POJO (Plain Old Java Object) to XML and back from XML to
POJO using marshaling/un-marshaling tool.
1.1
1. Create XML document that represents an object with the list of its dependent objects (like Student
with a list of Subjects assigned). Fill this xml document with data (not less than 10 dependent
objects).
2. Create the DTD schema and validate the xml document against this DTD (using tools like XML plugin
for Notepad++).
3. Create XSD schema and validate the xml document against this XSD.
1.2
1. Using java.net package capabilities, create simple server Java class which sends the xml file over
network.
2. Using java.net package capabilities, create simple client Java class which receives the xml file sent
by server over network. Both client and server could be located on single local machine and operate
over localhost.
3. Prepare POJO classes: create Java class with different field types (String, int, float, boolean, char,
etc.). This POJO class represents the root object in xml file (e.g., Student class). Create Java class that
represents dependent object (e.g., Subject class) and add field of type List with the list of dependent
objects to the root class. For example, the class Student could have a list of Subjects associated with
this Student.
4. Create Java class which is capable to perform JAXB transformation from POJO to XML and back from
XML to POJO.
5. Transform the received over network xml file to POJO and print its values to the standard output
(console). The XML document should be validated against XSD schema.
6. Transform POJO class to xml document and print it to the standard output (console).
Requirements
1. The entire code should be properly formatted.
2. The Unit tests for all classes should present.
3. The package/class/field/method names should conform to the naming conventions.
4. The entire code should be properly documented and JavaDoc generated.
5. The entire code should conform to S.O.L.I.D principles.
6. For transformation the separate class should be created with 2 public methods:
transformToXML() and transformToPOJO(). All transformation logic should be encapsulated inside
this class.
